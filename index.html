<h1>Photography</h1>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>The First Camera</h3>
<p>Photography (or the first camera) was first introduced around 1800 by a man named Thomas Wedgwood. He used white leather coated with silver nitrate, but 
unfortunately he only succeded in capturing the shadows of the image, and eventually it all turned black. Then in 1888 Kodak
made a camera that used a 20 foot roll of papaer. The next great improvment was the
switch to film in 1889.</p>
<h3>Film Cameras</h3>
<p>Eventually cameras advanced to the point where they started using film to capture the image. In order to get the image onto the film you would have to "expose"  it,
 this means you have to press the shutter button to open the hole where the film is in order for the chemicals on the film to react to the light. 
In order to get colored pictures you need to have several layers of emulsion, whereas black and white pictures only have
one layer of this. The drawbacks of film are very great however because it could take hours or days to process the film 
and now we can just snap and send with the power of digital cameras.</p>
<h3>Digital Cameras</h3>
<p>Now, we use digital cameras to capture digital images, digital cameras are a lot like film cameras exept for the fact that they use an electronic sensor to capture
 the image. The sensor of a digital camera is made of silicon with a grid of tiny pixels that are light sensitive and there are millions of these. The sensor on these cameras can vary and when the sensor
gets smaller then so does the amount of pixles. After the image is captured it is saved on an SD card. 
Then later you can plug the SD card into the computer and transfer the files to your desktop or laptop.</p>
<h3>DSLRs</h3>
<p>One of the main selling points of DSLRs is the fact that they have interchangable lenses, so you can always get the perfect shot. The unfortunate part is that most 
DSLRs are very expensive and the lenses are almost just as expensive as the body. Another great part about DSLRs is they normally have a viewfinder which makes it very 
easy to frame your shot, the viewfinder shows you exactly what your sensor will capture. In the end if your picture turns out bad you can add a filter to make it better.
After you take the shot it saves the photo on and  SD card just like a digital camera.</p>
